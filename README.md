# JavaScript-Diamond-Bug
### A bug fixing exercise

This repo contains a JavaScript function with HTML demo that contains a bug.

The function should output a diamond starting at 'a' going upto a given letter at the widest point of the diamond and 
returning to 'a' at the bottom.

Example using the letter 'd':
```
    a    
   b  b   
  c    c  
 d      d
  c    c  
   b  b   
    a  
```

You mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fix this function so that it operates correctly, using the 
JavaScript debugger for support.
