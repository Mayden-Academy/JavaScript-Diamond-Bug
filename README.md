# JavaScript-Diamond-Bug
### A bug fixing exercise

This repo contains a JavaScript function with HTML demo that contains a bug.

The function should output a diamond starting at 'a' going upto a given letter at the widest point of the diamond and 
returning to 'a' at the bottom.

You mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fix this function so that it operates correctly, using the 
JavaScript debugger for support.
